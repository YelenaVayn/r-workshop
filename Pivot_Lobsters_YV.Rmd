## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
library(skimr) # install.packages("skimr")
library(kableExtra) # install.packages ("kableExtra")

# read in lobster data
lobsters <- read_xlsx("data/lobsters2.xlsx", skip=4)
skimr::skim(lobsters) #explicitly stated from skimr
skim(lobsters) # not explicit
```


```{r}
lobsters %>% 
  group_by(year, site) %>%
summarise(count_by_year = n(), 
          mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(data=siteyear_summary, aes(x = year, y = median_size_mm, color = site)) + geom_line()
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
